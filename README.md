# Wk1-HW-Dbox

This is the Week 1 Assignment to complete the dropbox app. 

It took me roughly 8-10 hours over the past few days to complete this (and admittedly I still have some bugs I don't know how to fix). 

I completed required stories 1-7 for the most part. I ran into some issue where some of my buttons would force the app to crash when trying to move to a Tab Bar Controller.
