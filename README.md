# Week-1-Dropbx

After some initial technical difficulties due to some weird xCode versioning issue, this project took me between 8-10 hours to complete.

I completed stories 1-7, though admittedly there are some issues, mainly with some buttons causing the app to crash that I don't know how to fix.

Here's the gifs.
